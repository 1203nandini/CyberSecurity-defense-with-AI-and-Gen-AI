 # Role of AI in Cybersecurity

 1. Threat Detection and Prevention
AI analyzes vast amounts of real-time data to identify abnormal behavior and potential risks. It can recognize patterns that are often missed by human analysts.

 2. Malware Detection
Using advanced algorithms, AI can detect both known and unknown malware by analyzing file behavior instead of relying only on traditional signatures.

 3. Phishing Detection
AI models analyze email content, metadata, and sender behavior to recognize phishing attempts with high accuracy.

 4. User Behavior Analytics (UBA/UEBA)
AI builds detailed profiles of normal user behavior. If a user suddenly acts outside their usual pattern, AI can instantly detect it and flag possible insider threats or compromised accounts.

 5. Automated Incident Response
AI can:
- Isolate compromised devices
- Reset or block accounts
- Apply patches
- Contain threats before they spread

 6. Predictive Threat Analysis
By analyzing historical attack data, AI can accurately predict future cyber threats and anticipate attack vectors.

 7. Vulnerability Assessment
AI-powered scanners assess networks and systems for weaknesses, ensuring timely patching and reducing exposure to attackers.

 8. AI Security Chatbots
AI-driven chatbots provide instant responses to employee security queries, offering guidance on best practices and helping to prevent human error.

# AI Integration with Traditional Tools

- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):**
  AI enhances SIEM by reducing false positives and providing centralized visibility of threats.

- **Threat Intelligence:**
  AI continuously updates detection rules by analyzing past and emerging attacks.

- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**
  AI monitors laptops, mobiles, and IoT devices for unusual activity.

- **UEBA (User & Entity Behavior Analytics):**
  Detects unusual insider behavior and compromised accounts.
